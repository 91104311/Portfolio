# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Fraud is a problem for any bank. Fraud can take many forms, whether it is someone stealing a single credit card, to large batches of stolen credit card numbers being used on the web, or even a mass compromise of credit card numbers stolen from a merchant via tools like credit card skimming devices.

## Overall Task:

Build a predictive model to determine whether a given transaction will be fraudulent or not.

## Datasets: 
I used credit card transactions dataset for this project. This data, which is in line-delimited JSON format, can be found [here](https://github.com/CapitalOneRecruiting/DS). Note that this dataset loosely resembles real transactional data from Capital One credit card customers, but the entities and relations within are purely fictional. No persons, places, or things lost their identity in the making of this dataset.
