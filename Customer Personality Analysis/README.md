# Customer Personality Analysis
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company's ideal customers. It helps a business to understand its customers better. It makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business modify its product based on its target customers from different customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company's database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only to that particular segment.

## Overall Task:
- Perform unsupervised clustering of data on customer records from a grocery firm's database to optimize the significance of each customer to the business
- Profile customers into multiple clusters according to family structures, education, income, and spending by using dimensionality reduction techniques followed by clustering algorithms


## Datasets: 
This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) contains four different types of attributes, including information regarding People, Products, Promotion, and Place.
