# Projects


<!-- Customer Personality Analysis  -->
#

This project aims to perform customer clustering analysis using unsupervised machine learning. Customer personality analysis helps businesses to understand their customers and makes it easier for them to provide services according to the specific behaviors of each type of customer.

<!-- Customer Churn Prediction  -->
#

I delivered a Machine Learning solution to anticipate renewal likelihood (i.e., a retention model) in order to rank renewal opportunity by the risk that boosts long-term customer retention and renewal rate by 20%.

<!-- Credit Card Fraud Detection  -->
# 
<img align="left" width="240" height="140" src="https://github.com/91104311/Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Fraud%20Detection.jpeg"> [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/91104311/Portfolio/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection)

In this project, I created classification models such as Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Ensemble methods to detect fraudulent behavior based on imbalanced fraudulent credit card transaction datasets.

<!-- Readmission Prediction for Patients with Diabetes  -->
# 
<img align="left" width="240" height="140" src="https://github.com/91104311/Portfolio/blob/main/Images/READMISSION.jpeg"> [Patients Readmission Prediction](https://github.com/91104311/Portfolio/tree/main/Readmission%20Prediction%20for%20Patients%20with%20Diabetes)

I built classification machine learning models to predict if a patient with diabetes will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. I utilized models such as Gradient Boosting & AdaBoost, and different techniques such as sampling, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to improve results.

<!-- New York Airbnb Price Prediction  -->
# 
<img align="left" width="240" height="140" src="https://github.com/91104311/Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Airbnb.jpeg"> [Airbnb Price Prediction](https://github.com/91104311/Portfolio/tree/main/New%20York%20Airbnb%20Price%20Prediction)

This project seeks to predict Airbnb prices by deploying Regression machine learning models using data for listing activities, hosts, geographical availability, and other necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions in New York for 2019. 



<!-- Movie Recommendation Engine  -->
# 
<img align="left" width="240" height="140" src="https://github.com/91104311/Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Movie.jpeg"> [Movie Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/91104311/Portfolio/tree/main/Movie%20Recommendation%20Engine)

I developed a movie recommendation system using demographic filtering, content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and a hybrid recommender based on over 45,000 movies, 26 million ratings, and over 270,000 users from the MovieLens dataset.
